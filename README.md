# Smart-Task-Analyser
Smart Task Analyzer is a full-stack Django project that exposes APIs to score and sort tasks by priority based on due dates, importance, estimated effort, and dependencies. The frontend lets users add tasks, choose different strategies like “Fastest Wins” or “Deadline Driven”, and view color‑coded recommendations for the top tasks to do today.
